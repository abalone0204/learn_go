# Note of Learning Go

# Prerequisite

- Visit [The tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), know some basic syntax

- In my opinion, the practice of the tour of Go is quite helpful.
(But without well explaination, sometimes is also confusing)

# Goal

- Learn how to write idiomatic Go code. (Follow the convention in Go)
